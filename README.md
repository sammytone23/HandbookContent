## Input

### Mouse
- Diagram
    - ![Mouse Diagram](mouse-personal-computer.jpg) [1]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - move along surface, depress LMOUSE and RMOUSE, turn scrollwheel
    - What it does:
        - translates movement along a surface to movement of the cursor on a computer, and presses of LMOUSE and RMOUSE to left and right clicks, and movement of scrollwheel to scrolling. Sometimes includes other buttons for macros

### Keyboard
- Diagram
    - 
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Depress a key to send the labled letter or command to the computer connected to it.
    - What it does:
        - Each key is it's own key switch  that when depressed, sends a signal to the control chip inboard the keyboard, which then sends it to the computer it is connected to.

## Output

### Data Projector
- Diagram
    - ![Data Projector Diagram](working-of-a-3LCD-projector.png) [3]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - To use a product like this, you must have:
            1. A computer or device to output video
            2. Some sort of cable to transport the video, there are different cables that allow for different quality.
        - To use it you:
            1. Plug the cable into both the Output device and the plasma screen
    - What it does:
        - One lamp projects light into Dichronic mirrors tha separate the light into colours, then these colours are reflected into LCD screens that change the brightness, then theese streams are combined using a prism

### Speaker

    - ![Audio Jack Diagram](AudioJackDiagram.jpg) [5]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - To use a product like this you must have:
            1. A computer or device to output video
            2. A speaker
        - To use it you:
            1. Plug the Audio Cable attached to the speaker into the output device
    - What it does:
        - Wattage into the speaker goes through a copper cable surrounding a ring inside a magetised ring, and outside an oppositely magnetised pole. This causes the ring to move up and down, moving a diaphragm which moves the air in sound waves.

## Processors

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Diagram
    - ![CPU Diagram](481px-ABasicComputer.gif) [6]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Commands for the CPU are stored in ram, usually with the middle-man of a User Interface.
    - What it does:
        - It makes simple calculations at extremely quick speeds, depending on the hertz of the processor, 1Hz is one calculation per second, 3GHz is 3 billion calculations per second.

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
- Diagram
    - ![GPU Diagram](1200px-Generic_block_diagram_of_a_GPU.svg.png) [7]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - Similar to the CPU, Commands for the GPU are stored in the RAM, but the GPU is faster, as it is used for graphics
    - What it does:
        - Makes simple calculations at quicker speeds than the CPU, again depending on the Hertz.

## Storage

### HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- Diagram
    - ![HDD Diagram](hdd-diagram.jpg) [8]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - to interface with a Hard disk drive, you connect it to a computer, via the plug connection on hte side, then the operating system should recognise it and allow you to interperet the date stored on it.
    - What it does:
        - Hard disk drives store data with magnetism, magnetising and demagnetising tiny sections on the large disc in side the hard drive, the Platter. these strings of magnetised and demagnetised sections represent bits, and come together to represent binary strings. these can then be interpereted into text, or images, or anything else you can see or hear on a computer.

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Diagram
    - ![RAM Diagram](memory-RAM-and-Slot-Diagram.png) [9]
- Definition
    - How to use it:
        - RAM is used whenever doing anything on a computer. When opening an executeable, the core files of said program are stored in RAM for faster access, and anything else you do is also stored there.
    - What it does:
        - RAM ,or Random Access Memory, is memory used for the task at hand, and requires the computer to be on to store data. The purpose, and namesake of this device is to be used as fast as possible at any time (__Random__ Access memory).
